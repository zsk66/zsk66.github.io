I am Shengkun Zhu, a second-year Ph. D student at Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Sheng Wang](http://sheng.whu.edu.cn/), in the [Totem database Lab](http://totemdb.whu.edu.cn/). I am also lucky to have opportunities to collaborate with Prof. [Jianshan Zeng](https://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=au5gb2EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), Dr. [Yuan Sun](https://scholars.latrobe.edu.au/y6sun), and Prof. [Yuan Yao](https://yao-lab.github.io/). I completed my B.S. at Dalian University of Technology in 2018. My current research interests are in convex/nonconvex optimization, federated, and fair clustering/learning.

I love spending time with my lovely cat, <font color=blue>Geometry</font>. 
When he was still a little baby, his face was quite pointed, but now it has become chubby.
