I am Shengkun Zhu, a first-year Ph. D student at Wuhan University, under the supervision of Prof. [Sheng Wang](http://sheng.whu.edu.cn/). I completed my B.S in Dalian University of Technology (DUT) in 2018. Following that, I worked in the Chinese military for five years and earned my M.S. My current research interests are in federated and fair clustering/learning.
